I have more than 10 years of experience with Software Engineering getting strong programming and design skills about distributed,
fault tolerance and high availability architectures using open source.

I am motivated by the pleasure of writing source code. I like to figure out the best solution for every problem, using all the programming
I have been learning these years: readable, reusable and documented code and unit testing.
